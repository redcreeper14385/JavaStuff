# JavaStuff
Just a bunch of files created when I learned Java. You can check out my progress step-by-step, and I've commented my code in detail,
to help out those learning Java themselves.

*Note: If you're wondering what classmethodstuff.txt is, it's a template of the base class and method code that is required for all Java
files, becuase I'm not using a specialised Java IDE.*
